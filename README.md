**Studyficient** is designed to help users have more convenience and improved focus in their study sessions by allowing them
to collect notes and videos in one location and save it in their account. Users can create notes on any subject they choose
and organize their notes and videos by accordingly.

By logging into **Studyficient**, users have access to their Studyspace:
